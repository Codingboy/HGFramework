# General Missiondesign
At startup all players have a little time to group up with other players if they want to.  
Then all players will be teleported to the arena.  
All players only have uniform, rangemasterbelt, map, gps, radio, watch, compass.  
There are 16 mines around each player so do not move!  
The mines will be deactivated after some time.  
Around the start are also a few lootcrates. But only in the middle are weapons.  
The mission is finished when all players except one are dead.  
There also may be lootcrates around if the missionmaker placed it.  
After some time all players are warned for a sudden death. All players have to travel to a defined location or die.  
It is important to find water/food!
