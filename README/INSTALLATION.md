## Recommendations
If you decided to play an example mission in multiplayer open "patchVariables.sqf" and remove the "//" in front of the line that contains your missionname.
That causes the change of some variables to make them better fit for the mission.

All examples are fully playable multiplayer missions.  
Recommended playernumber for the missions:
* example_stratis.sqm: 6-12 player
* example2_stratis.sqm: 4-12 player
* example_altis.sqm: 12-24 player
