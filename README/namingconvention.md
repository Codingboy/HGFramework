# Copyrightissues & Namingconvention
To not get in trouble with copyrightowners of Hunger Games I recommend you to not name your mission "Hunger Games" or so.  
Instead I recommend you to name it for example "dm@24_Hangar-Games_1-0-0".  
I also saw a mission called "Hunting Games" and the Minecraft "Survival Games".  
Be creative but better do not use "Hunger Games".
