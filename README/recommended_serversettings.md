# Recommended Serversettings

A recommended settingfile is delivered with the framework.
It is called RecommendedServerSettings.Arma3Profile.
To use it instead of your own settings file you have to start ArmA 3 with the option -profiles=C:\\path\\to\\settingsfile\\RecommendedServerSettings.Arma3Profile.
If you prefer to change you settings I strongly recommend you to use most of the following settings:
* EnemyTag disabled
* AutoSpot disabled
* WeaponCursor disabld
* 3rdPersonView disabled
* DeathMessages disabled
